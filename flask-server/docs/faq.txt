;What are the ramifications of threats and safeguards to independence?	Safeguards > Threats = IndependenceThreats > Safeguards = No Independence
;What are the threats to independence?	Self-Review (Auditing own work)Advocate of the ClientAdverse Interest (Lawsuit against Client)Too familiar with Client – could impair the appearance of Independence to publicUndue influence on Client - On BOD, exception being an Honorary board position
;What are the Safeguards to independence?	Offset the threatsSafeguards are created by Legislation (SOX), Client (Audit Committee), Accounting Firm (Policies)
;What are the characteristics of a Covered Member?	On the engagement team, have Significant influence on Audit, such as:Reviewing PartnerManaging Partner in CPA FirmFirm Personnel who does more than 10 hours of non-attest work (Income Taxes)Partner sharing office with another Partner who oversees an engagementFinancial Interest in Client by Covered Member (Auditor on Engagement)
;What are the requirements for a Covered Member?	No direct financial interestNo Material indirect financial interestFirm personnel who are not Covered Members cannot own more than 5% of stock Covered Member's immediate family cannot own more than 5% of stock or be employed in Key positions. If Covered member is aware of this, it will impair independence.Cannot make management decisions.All requirements apply during the period of the professional engagement, and as long as they are a client.
;What happens when a Covered Member disagrees with a Supervisor?	If Supervisor's position is still GAAP/GAAS, defer to SupervisorIf Supervisor's position is not GAAP/GAAS, report to higher levels of managementIf management ignores you, consider leaving the firm

;List some common consulting engagements.	Advisory ServicesTransaction ServicesManagement ConsultingImplementation Services
;What is the rule concerning contingent fees for a covered member?	Not allowed if Member also performs services where independence is requiredCommissions or referral fees for Covered Members are not allowedExample – Audit firm gets a commission for recommending to Client that they implement a new A/P System...NOT AllowedIf a firm performing non-attest work doesn't also perform Covered Member services (aka – Independence notrequired), then Firm can get a commission on referring products/services, but they must disclose to the ClientTax Preparation - Payment according to refund amount is disallowed
;When are contingent fees allowed?	When fees are structured relative to judicial proceedings.Example: IRS audit, or filing an amended tax return subject to tax case with a different taxpayer.
;How should recommendations and suggestions by a covered member to a client be handled?	Client must carry them out - covered member cannot perform management functions.Client must assign someone of competence to oversee the non-attest engagement and CPA must be satisfied that this has occurred.

;When is a GAAP departure appropriate?	Departure from GAAP is appropriate if GAAP would cause F/S to be misleading, then it must be explained/disclosed.
;When may a covered member disclose confidential information?	Member may disclose confidential info when client isn't following GAAPORIf they receive a subpoena – CPAs are not Attorneys, so there is no CPA-Client privilege
;What is the effect of not returning all client-provided documents upon request?	This is an act discreditable.You MUST return all documents the client gives you even if they don't pay their bill.If you create a document, however, like a work paper, you are not required to give the client a copy of papers you created if they haven't paid their billThey are the firm's work papers, but are still confidential!

If partner dies and more than one partner still remains (i.e. 1 dies and you still have 2 or more partners...you don't need to change the name)All Partners/Shareholders must be members of the AICPA in order to hold themselves out as members of the AICPA. Non-CPA's can be owners, but 2/3 of Ownership must be CPAs. Non-CPA owner must not be involved with the accounting, and is still bound by AICPA code of conduct, must maintain CPE requirements and have Bachelor's degree.

;What is Audit Sampling?	Taking part of a population, subjecting it to audit procedures, projecting results to a population
;What are the characteristics of Statistical Sampling?	Based on formulasHelps find an appropriate audit sampleHelps evaluate evidence obtainedHelps evaluate results and quantify Sampling Risk
;What are the characteristics of Non-Statistical Sampling?	Based on human decisionEqually acceptable as Statistical Sampling
;What are the characteristics of Substantive Tests?	Variable samplingProbability proportionate to size sampling
;What type of sampling are Control Tests?	Attribute Sampling
;What is Sampling Risk?	Risk that your sample isn’t representative of populationCan happen even if audit is done properly
;What is the risk of assessing Control Risk too high?	A risk of Control Testing - Auditor works to make Control Risk lowerMore substantive tests - Sample overstates Control Risk, Leads to an under-reliance on internal control, over-testing, and overall audit inefficiencyAudit ends up being effective (correct result), but you do more work
;What is the risk of assessing Control Risk too low?	A risk of Control Testing - Complement to Confidence Level Inverse relationship to Sample SizeHigher accepted risk of assessing Control Risk too low = Smaller SampleLower accepted risk of assessing Control Risk too low = Larger Sample
;What are the risks if the auditor concludes controls are operating effectively based on the sample and Control Risk is set too low?	Leads to higher Detection Risk - Fewer substantive testsSample understates Control RiskThis error leads to over-reliance on internal control, undertesting, and overall audit ineffectiveness.Does NOT necessarily mean that the F/S are materially misstated – it does mean that if there is one, you are less likely to find it
;What is the risk of Incorrect Acceptance?	A risk of Substantive Testing - Auditor accepts a balance as fairly stated, when in fact it is not fairly statedHurts audit effectivenessWrong conclusion reachedEfficient, but not effective
;What is the risk of Incorrect Rejection?	A risk of Substantive Testing - Auditor rejects balance as fairly stated when in fact it is fairly statedHurts audit efficiencyWrong recommendations givenEffective, but not efficient
;What is Non-Sampling Risk?	Risk of human (auditor) missing an errorAlso called exception, error or deviation.
;How does Sampling Risk compare to Non-Sampling Risk?	Sampling Risk deals with the chance that your audit sample is flawedNon-Sampling risk deals with the chance that your human decisions/conclusions are flawed
;What is Attribute Sampling?	Looking at Control Procedures - Were invoices approved when paid? Errors are stated in terms of %, not dollar amountsFor example, 5 invoices out of 100 were not properly paid. Error rate is 5%Hint: If you see Error Rate on the Exam, they are referring to Attribute Sampling.
;How do you determine if Control Procedures are operating properly or not operating properly?	Control Procedures are either operating properly or they are not operating properly – based on Error Rate and the tolerance you have for errors
;What is the Tolerable Rate?	Error rate in population that you are willing to accept/tolerateInverse relationship to Sample SizeHigher Tolerable Rate = Smaller SampleLower Tolerable Rate = Larger SampleIf you’re willing to accept a higher probability that errors exist, there is less pressure on the sample
;What is the Expected Population Error Rate?	What Error Rate are you expecting? - Judgment call, based on experienceDirect relationship to Sample SizeMore errors = Larger SampleLess errors = Smaller Sample
;What is the basic premise of Attribute Sampling?	Attribute in the sample gives information about the entire audit populationUsed to estimate Internal Control error rate
;For what is the Expected Population Deviation (error) Rate used?	Used to determine initial level of Control Risk
;What is the Allowable Risk of Overreliance?	Risk of Assessing Control Risk too lowGives you the Sampling Risk
;When is Attribute sampling used?	Attribute sampling is only useful when there is documented evidence (an audit trail) to testUse when the existence of an error needs to be verified or debunked
;What is Classic Variable Sampling?	Testing for a dollar amountValue in sample gives information about value in entire population.
;What functions are used in conjunction with Classic Variable Sampling?	Mean Per Unit  = Sample Average x Number in PopulationStratification - Decreases effect of variance in population and reduces sample size
;What are the characteristics of Probability Proportionate to Size sampling?	A form of Variable SamplingDoes NOT use Standard DeviationAuditor focuses on a dollar amountLarger or more valuable items get picked more often as part of the sample
;What is Projected Misstatement?	Misstatement found in sample – have to project it to remainder of population
;How does Probability Proportionate to Size sampling compare to Variable sampling?	PPS:Easier to use, Results in a stratified (homogenous) sample, Results in a smaller sample size to audit, Easy to designClassic Variable Sampling:Easy to expand sample size, Selecting zero and negative balances easy
;What factors affect sample size?	Tolerable rate for error - Inverse relationship with sample sizeRisk of assessing Control Risk too low - Inverse relationship with sample sizeExpected population error rate - Direct relationship with sample sizePopulation size does NOT affect the sample size - as population is larger, sample size doesn't grow.
;What is the formula for Audit Sampling?	SER + ASR < TERSER = Sample Error RateASR = Allowance for Sampling RiskTER = Tolerable Error Rate
;What is Allowance for Sampling Risk?	The amount that you add to the Sampling Error Rate to get some cushion for your sample.As high as you think the population error rate could go based on experience.
;What is the Tolerable Error Rate?	The amount of error rate that you can accept - If population error rate is less than TER, then accept the Control as effectiveIf population error rate is more than TER, do more testing to get SER lower or conclude control isn’t effective. Do more substantive testing
;What are the steps to develop a sampling plan?	Determine Test Objective - for example, have sales shipments been billed?Define Population and Deviation - take a sample of shipping document, trace forward to see if billedDetermine Sample Size based on tolerable rate for error, risk of assessing Control Risk too low, and expected population error rate.Select Sampling Technique
;After a Sampling Plan is developed, what are the steps in sampling?	Perform the Sampling PlanEvaluate ResultsDocument Results
;What is Systematic Sampling?	"Every certain # of a population is selectedPopulation needs to be randomly orderedPrimary advantage is that population doesn’t require pre-numbering"
;What is Sequential Sampling?	"Also called ""Stop or Go"" samplingEach audit step determines the next step"
;What is Discovery Sampling?	Audit is testing an area that is so crucial, then zero population errors can be toleratedAny phony employees on payroll?
;How does Block Sampling compare to other sampling methods?	Easy to implement, but is the worst method of sampling.
